# Chess AI
This project is a game of chess with the complete ruleset and basic AI. This project is programmed as an individual project for my personal educational purpose. 

The board representation was programmed with the help of OpenGL. The individual chess pieces were formed with basic geometric shapes due to some difficulties with importing images of the chess pieces.

The rules and AI were programmed with C++ to allow the interactions within the game. The artificial intelligence was programmed based on the alpha-beta algorithm in the negamax framework to eliminates the unnecssary search in order to decrease search time.
